I'm a programmer and artist. I've worked for a year as a python developer building automations and libraries. 

This blog is an effort to create my own little camp of insights and knowledge in the vast internet cosmos. Having discovered so much wisdom in the writing of other developers, I want to give back and be helpful to others.
