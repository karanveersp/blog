For the first post, I want to describe the purpose of this blog.

To share and explore the craft of programming by writing simple tutorials and articles. We don't truly master something until we teach it so I want to challenge myself by consolidating and conveying all that I know for others.

I like Python, TypeScript and Go so most of the posts will have something to do them and their ecosystem. However, I also want to explore the principles of programming that lie at the heart of all languages.
